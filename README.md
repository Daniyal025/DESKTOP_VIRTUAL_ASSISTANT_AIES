# AIES CCP Project

This project is part of the Artificial Intelligence Expert System (AIES) coursework under the CCP initiative. It involves building a rule-based expert system using Python, aiming to simulate decision-making in a chosen knowledge domain.

## 📌 Project Title
**Rule-Based Expert System for Career Recommendation**

## 🧠 Objective
To develop an expert system that provides career path suggestions to users based on their interests, preferences, and skills. The system utilizes a knowledge base of rules defined using Python and CLIPS-like logic.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Simple rule-based logic (implemented in Python)
- Console-based user interface

## 📁 Files
- `main.py`: Contains the source code of the rule-based expert system.
- `AIES_CCP_Project_Report.pdf`: The documentation report explaining the system's design, implementation, and evaluation.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the files.
3. Open a terminal in the project directory.
4. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🧩 Features
- Asks a series of questions to the user regarding their interests and strengths.
- Uses IF-THEN rules to deduce a suitable career path.
- Outputs career suggestions like:
  - Software Developer
  - Data Scientist
  - Graphic Designer
  - Network Engineer
  - etc.

## 📝 Sample Interaction
```
Do you enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking? (yes/no): yes
Do you prefer working with computers? (yes/no): yes
Do you enjoy working with data? (yes/no): yes

Suggested Career Path: Data Scientist
```

## 🧠 Rule-Based Logic Example
```python
if logic == "yes" and computer == "yes" and data == "yes":
    print("Suggested Career Path: Data Scientist")
```

## 📚 Report Highlights
- Description of expert systems and rule-based logic.
- Explanation of system architecture.
- Justification of chosen domain and rule creation.
- Test results and evaluation of system performance.
